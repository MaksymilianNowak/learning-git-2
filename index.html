            <h1>Land of Confusion</h1>
            <h2>by Genesis or cover Disturbed</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
                    Been haunted by a million screams
                    But I can hear the marching feet
                    They're moving into the street
                    Now did you read the news today?
                    They say the danger's gone away
                    But I can see the fires still alight
                    They're burning into the night</p>

                   <p> There's too many men, too many people
                    Making too many problems
                    And not much love to go 'round
                    Can't you see this is a land of confusion?</p>

                    <p> is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
                    And these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
                    Use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
                    To make it a place worth living in</p>

                   <p>Oh, Superman, where are you now
                    When everything's gone wrong somehow?
                    The men of steel, the men of power
                    Are losing control by the hour</p>

                   <p> This is the time, this is the place
                    So we look for the future
                    But there's not much love to go 'round
                    Tell me why this is a land of confusion</p>

                    <p>This is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
                    And these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
                    Use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
                    To make it a place worth living in</p>

                    <p>I remember long ago
                    Oh, when the sun was shining
                    Yes, and the stars were bright all through the night
                    And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
                    So long ago</p>

                   <p> I won't be coming home tonight
                    My generation will put it right
                    We're not just making promises
                    That we know we'll never keep</p>

                   <p> Too many men, there's too many people
                    Making too many problems
                    And not much love to go 'round
                    Can't you see this is a land of confusion?</p>

                    <p>Now this is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
                    And these are the hands we're given (oh, oh, oh)
                    Use them and let's start trying (oh, oh, oh)
                    To make it a place worth fighting for</p>

                   <p> This is the world we live in (oh, oh, oh)
                    And these are the names we're given (oh, oh, oh)
                    Stand up and let's start showing (oh, oh, oh)
                    Just where our lives are going to</p>
